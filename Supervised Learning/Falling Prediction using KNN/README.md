### k-Nearest Neighbors (in 3 easy steps)
First develop each piece of the algorithm, then will tie all of the elements together into a working implementation applied to a real dataset.

This k-Nearest Neighbors tutorial is broken down into 3 parts:

          * Step 1: Calculate Euclidean Distance.
          * Step 2: Get Nearest Neighbors.
          * Step 3: Make Predictions.
These steps will teach you the fundamentals of implementing and applying the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm for classification and regression predictive modeling problems.
