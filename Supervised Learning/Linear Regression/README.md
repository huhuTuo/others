# Linear regression using the Normal Equation.

### The Normal Equation

To find the value of θ that minimizes the cost function, there is a closed-form solution—in other words, a mathematical equation that gives the result directly. This is called the Normal Equation.

         Normal Equation
                  ˆ
                  θ =(X⊺X)-1 X⊺ y
         In this equation:

                  θ is the value of θ that minimizes the cost function.

                  y is the vector of target values containing y(1) to y(m).
