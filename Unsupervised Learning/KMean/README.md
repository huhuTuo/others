# Overfitting to evaluate Linear Regression Model and Non-linear Regression

### Suppose we collect a set of sample data and distribute the sample data by

         Training phase: 50%
         Validation phase: 25%
         Test phase: 25%
         
Note: The values of "x" in "ŷ=a1 + b1 * x" and "ŷ=a2 + b2 * x2" are the same as the "x" list on the "Real Data Set".

Program 1: To implement Linear Regression Model 1

         This program is to use RealData Set 1 to determine a1 and b1 based on Model 1.
         The program can be used to fill part of the blank spaces in above table.

Program 2: Non-Linear Regression Model 2

         This program is to use RealData Set 1 to determine a2 and b2 based on Model 2.
         The program can be used to fill part of the blank spaces in above table.

Program 3: Calculate MSE
